    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 goat steaks, about 1 inch thick each</li>
        <li>1 cup sheep's milk yoghurt</li>
        <li>4 medium gloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 packed tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped</li>
        <li>plenty of sea salt and freshly cracked pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the goat with salt and pepper, being sure to rub it in very well.</li>
        <li>Combine the yoghurt, garlic, and oregano and add this to the goat, again, rubbing it in very well. Allow it to sit overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat your cast iron skillet to medium-high heat and add a small amount of vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Cook the steaks quickly – about 2 minutes per side. Goat can dry out very quickly (as I have learned) so watch it closely and don’t hesitate to take it off the heat if you think it is drying too much. You are probably right.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and tent with foil for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
